To start, you must load the haskell file.
For Question 1, you can load the file through GHCI by running "ghci".
    - After GHCI is loaded, run ":l comp3007-w19_101044511_a2_1.hs"
    - Then you can run "showAsASCIIArt(convertPictureToASCII(" .+%#@", False, loadBitmap "sample_image_to_search.bmp")))"

For Question 2, you can load the file through GHCI by running "ghci".
    - After GHCI is loaded, run ":l comp3007-w19_101044511_a2_2.hs"
    - Then you can run "findPicture showAsASCIIArt(convertPictureToASCII(" .+%#@", False, loadBitmap "sample_image_to_search.bmp"))) showAsASCIIArt(convertPictureToASCII(" .+%#@", False, loadBitmap "sample_image_to_find.bmp")))"
